<p align="right"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pink_floyd16.jpg" /><em>Pink Floyd - Division Bell:</em> <font size="3"><strong>Keep Talking</strong></font></p>
<p>For millions of years mankind lived just like animals Then something happened which unleashed the power of our imagination We learned to talk </p>
<p align="center">There's a silence surrounding me I can't seem to think straight I'll sit in the corner No one can bother me I think I should speak now Why won't you talk to me I can't seem to speak now You never talk to me My words won't come out right What are you thinking I feel like I'm drowning <br />What are you feeling I'm feeling weak now Why won't you talk to me But I can't show my weakness <br />You never talk to me I sometimes wonder What are you thinking <br />Where do we go from here What are you feeling </p>
<p>It doesn't have to be like this All we need to do is make sure we keep talking </p>
