Egy yo beszelgetes I-val...  
  



![](http://kavics.freeblog.hu/Files/pink_floyd16.jpg)_Pink Floyd - Division Bell:_ **Keep Talking**  
  
For millions of years mankind lived just like animals Then something happened which unleashed the power of our imagination We learned to talk 




There's a silence surrounding me I can't seem to think straight I'll sit in the corner No one can bother me I think I should speak now Why won't you talk to me I can't seem to speak now You never talk to me My words won't come out right What are you thinking I feel like I'm drowning   
What are you feeling I'm feeling weak now Why won't you talk to me But I can't show my weakness   
You never talk to me I sometimes wonder What are you thinking   
Where do we go from here What are you feeling   
  
It doesn't have to be like this All we need to do is make sure we keep talking
