"There's nothing you can know that isn't known.  
Nothing you can see that isn't shown.  
Nowhere you can be that isn't where you're meant to be.  
It's easy.  
All you need is love, all you need is love,  
All you need is love, love, love is all you need.  
All you need is love (all together now)  
All you need is love (everybody)  
All you need is love, love, love is all you need." -Beatles...angolul tanulóknak egy jófajta mondatszerkezet..angolul tudóknak egy kis gondolkodni való..hogy is van/volt/lesz ez ÍGY?
