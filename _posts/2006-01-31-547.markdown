Bob Marley - I Can See Clearly Now  


  


I can see clearly now, the rain is gone,  


I can see all obstacles in my way  


Gone are the dark clouds that had me blind  


It's gonna be a bright (bright), bright (bright)  


Sun-Shiny day  


It's gonna be a bright (bright), bright (bright)  


Sun-Shiny day  


  


Oh yes I can make it now, the pain is gone  


All of the bad feelings have disappeared  


Here is the rainbow I've been prayin' for  


It's gonna be a bright (bright), bright (bright)  


Sun-Shiny day  


  


Look all around, there's nothin' but blue skies  


Look straight ahead, nothin' but blue skies  


  


I can see clearly now, the rain is gone,  


I can see all obstacles in my way  


Here is the rainbow I've been prayin' for  


It's gonna be a bright (bright), bright (bright)  


Sun-Shiny day  


It's gonna be a bright (bright), bright (bright)  


Sun-Shiny day  


bright (bright), bright (bright)  


Sun-Shiny day  


It's gonna be a bright (bright), bright (bright)  


Sun-Shiny day  


It's gonna be a bright (bright), bright (bright)  


Sun-Shiny day
