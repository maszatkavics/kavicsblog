<p>For millions of years mankind lived just like animals Then something happened which unleashed the power of our imagination We learned to talk</p>

<p>There’s a silence surrounding me I can’t seem to think straight I’ll sit in the corner No one can bother me I think I should speak now Why won’t you talk to me I can’t seem to speak now You never talk to me My words won’t come out right What are you thinking I feel like I’m drowning <br />
What are you feeling I’m feeling weak now Why won’t you talk to me But I can’t show my weakness <br />
You never talk to me I sometimes wonder What are you thinking <br />
Where do we go from here What are you feeling</p>

<p>It doesn’t have to be like this All we need to do is make sure we keep talking</p>
