<p>Kódolok, de közben azéert törpölök..multitask..meg kéne lovagolni valahogy a hullámot valahogy..még,még,jobban..inkább, nem csak sodródni a vízzel, fuldokolni, hánykolódni alul..hanem élvezni a szörfözést…a hullám tetején, a friss levegő csap arcomba.. de MI LEGYEN A DESZKA, ÉS HOL A HULLÁM?</p>
